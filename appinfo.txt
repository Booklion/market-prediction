Market Prediction Application

Market Predictor App

Description:
A simple Python application for predicting market fluctuations using a basic linear regression model. 
The application is organized into a package structure with modules for data generation and prediction. 
It includes a sample dataset (dataset.csv) representing synthetic market prices for the year 2023.

Directory Structure:
- market_predictor/
  - __init__.py
  - data_generator.py
  - predictor.py
- main_script.py
- dataset.csv

Usage:
1. Run main_script.py to perform market prediction using the provided dataset.
2. Explore and extend the functionality of the data_generator and predictor modules as needed.

Note: This is a basic educational example, and real-world market prediction applications would require more sophisticated models and extensive data analysis.
